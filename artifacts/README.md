# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains generated files from the NPS hiking data collection process.

## Contents

- `*.gpkg` - GeoPackage files with collected trail and boundary data
- `*.csv` - Generated CSV reports from collection scripts
- `test_results.xml` - pytest coverage reports

## Usage

- **Collection scripts** write output files here
- **Profiling modules** read from these files for analysis
- **Safe to delete** - all files can be regenerated by re-running collection scripts
- **Not version controlled** - these are temporary artifacts

## Regeneration

To regenerate all artifacts:
```bash
# Clear the directory
rm artifacts/*

# Re-run collection scripts
python scripts/collectors/nps_collector.py --write-db
python scripts/collectors/osm_hikes_collector.py --write-db
python scripts/collectors/tnm_hikes_collector.py --write-db
```

## Notes

- Files are generated during data collection runs
- Keep this directory structure for consistent file paths
- The `.gitkeep` file ensures this directory is tracked by Git
